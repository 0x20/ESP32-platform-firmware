## Officially supported BADGE.TEAM badges
These badges were developed for use with our platform and are our main development targets.

 - [The SHA2017 badge](sha2017)
 - [The Hackerhotel 2019 badge](hackerhotel-2019)
 - [The Disobey 2019 badge](disobey-2019)
 - [The CampZone 2019 "I-PANE"](campzone-2019)

## Other badges
We added or plan on adding build targets for these badges. They did not come with our software originally. Our effort is more of an "after market upgrade" so to say...

 - [Open Hardware Summit (OHS) 2018 badge](#)
 - [FRI3D camp 2018 badge](#)

## The CCC camp 2019 "CARD10" badge

The CARD10 uses the hatchery as it's app repository. For all other details about this project (the hardware, firmware and API) please have a look at the [CARD10 project](https://card10.badge.events.ccc.de/) over at the CCC website.
